Hi!

I've devoloped this as a fun side project when I started programming (a year ago). 
It requires no libraries you have to install (which means you can run this in school if they have python!).

Theres a few things I would like to change but I don't want to be kept on the same 
project for too long and I would most likely rewrite most of the code. 

This is just for fun and probably won't have updates for now. 

Have fun!
